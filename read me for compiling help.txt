I know 4 Programming languages

//pro tip before compiling c and or cpp turn off real time scanning so that there is fast output 

1. c
	compile: gcc filename.c
	run:     a
	//,/*      */ as comments

2.cpp
	compile: g++ filename.cpp
	run:     filename//sometimes fails then use 'a'
		(or)
	compile: g++ -o filename filename.cpp
	run:    filename.exe
	//,/*      */ as comments

3.java
	compile: javac filename.java
	run:	java filename
	//,/*      */,/**           */ as comments

4.python
	try typing "python"
	compile and run:python3 filename.py
		(or)
	compile and run: filename.py
	#as comment

Atom as text editor.
c and cpp can directly be compiled in my atom package installed.
when you get access denied error stop the real time scanning of antivirus installed.
And also python now enable the package "platform-ide-terminal"
useful at times cmd is also better.
compiles and run here will be "python filename.py" //bit slower so not that good
on enabling this package fn+f5 will not run cpp and c code.
